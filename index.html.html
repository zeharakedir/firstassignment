			<p>Another impressive characteristic of the starfish is their ability to regenerate different (missing) parts of their body. If predator eats part of the starfish, remaining part (one arm for example) will develop missing arms and bring back previous look after some time. This process is not always fast and it may last up to one year.</p>
